# AIML Lab Programs - SDMCET

## Overview

This repository contains all the programs taught in the Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AIML) Lab at SDMCET (2025).

## Important Note

GitHub only displays output values from print statements in Jupyter Notebooks and does not show input values.
To view the complete notebooks with inputs, it is highly recommended to clone the repository or download the notebooks locally.

## How to Run the Programs

To run the AIML Lab programs on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Python

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

* Download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* During installation, check the box **"Add Python to PATH"**.
* After installation, verify it by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### 2. Install Jupyter Notebook

With Python installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

To confirm Jupyter is installed:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

If Jupyter opens in your browser, itâ€™s ready to use.

### 3. Clone the Repository

Now, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoyM268/sdmcet-aiml.git
```

Or download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/JoyM268/sdmcet-aiml/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it manually.

### 4. Navigate to the Repository

Change into the cloned project directory:

```bash
cd sdmcet-aiml
```

### 5. Launch Jupyter Notebook

Start Jupyter Notebook with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Your default browser will open. From there, you can open any `.ipynb` file to view and run the lab programs.
